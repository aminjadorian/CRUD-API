# CRUD-API
This is a simple CRUD API that I've developed with Create, Update, Delete, and Read operations.
This project is developed using .NET Core (C# .NET 8) and includes the following features:

- .NET 8, C#
- ASP.NET Core
- CQRS
- Clean Architecture
- SQL Server
- DDD
- Unit Testing
- Fluent Validation
- MediatR
- Global Exception Handling
- etc.
I plan to add new features to it as soon as possible, such as Docker, etc.
